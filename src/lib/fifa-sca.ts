  what: [
    "The heart suddenly stops pumping. It usually comes without warning and can strike anyone — including players who look fit and healthy.",
    "Knowing CPR and how to use an AED is what makes the difference between life and death.",
  ],
  causes: [
    "Inherited heart-muscle diseases or structural heart anomalies.",
    "A viral illness such as flu combined with hard exercise over roughly 3–5 days, which can inflame the heart muscle.",
    "Medications, drugs and stimulants — they raise the risk during exercise.",
    "Rarely: the ball striking the centre of the chest at a vulnerable moment of the heartbeat.",
  ],
  signs: [
    {
      title: "Non-contact collapse",
      text: "A player who goes down without contact with another player, the ball or an obstacle has SCA until proven otherwise.",
    },
    { title: "Unresponsive", text: "No response at all to voice or touch." },
    {
      title: "Abnormal or absent breathing",
      text: "Breathing may look normal at first, then turns to gasping and usually stops within 60–90 seconds. Gasping is not normal breathing — do not let it reassure you.",
    },
    {
      title: "Brief seizure-like movements",
      text: "Slow involuntary jerks are part of SCA — treating it as a fit delays resuscitation.",
    },
  ],
  steps: [
    "Go to the player or official immediately — time is critical.",
    "Check whether they respond.",
    "Turn them onto their back, taking care of the neck.",
    "Call the local emergency number if no one else can help.",
    "Get the AED — it should be at every training session and match.",
    "While the AED is coming, start hands-only chest compressions and do not stop unless you must.",
    "Switch the AED on and follow its voice prompts.",
    "Keep going until the ambulance team takes over.",
  ],
  prevention: [
    "An emergency action plan (the FIFA PEAP) for every match and training session, known by all first-aid and medical staff.",
    "Know how to resuscitate a player on the pitch.",
    "Have an AED close by — and know exactly where it is.",
    "CPR and AED training for players, team and match officials and stadium staff, rehearsed regularly.",
    "Watch players closely during and after a viral illness.",
    "Medical evaluation and cardiac screening where resources allow.",
  ],
  setPiece:
    "FIFA's Medical Set Piece is a rehearsed script: each responder has one clearly defined, colour-coded job (black, blue, green, orange, red, white — the same colours as the PEAP), so everyone stays on task under pressure.",
  screening: [
    "Cardiac screening is mandatory before FIFA competitions: medical history, examination and an ECG, with further tests if needed.",
    "Youth players: start at about 12 years and repeat every 2–4 years — personal and family history, focused examination and a resting 12-lead ECG.",
    "No screening programme gives complete protection: early CPR, a prompt AED and an emergency plan give the best chance of survival.",
